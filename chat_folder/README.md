# Chat Folder

This folder is intended to store chat logs and user logs for each room. You can use this directory to save chat history or user lists as files if you want persistent storage or downloadable logs.

Currently, the app stores logs in memory. If you want to save logs to files, let me know and I can implement file-based logging for you!
